Airport Security Check Waiting Time Analysis is a Minor 1 project that applies Python-based data analysis to study passenger waiting times at airport security checkpoints across three major airports: JFK, LAX, and ORD. Using Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization, the project analyzes a synthetic dataset containing passenger IDs, airport locations, checkpoint types (Regular and PreCheck), days of the week, hours of travel, and recorded waiting times. The analysis includes calculating overall mean and standard deviation, comparing waiting times by checkpoint type, airport, and day, and examining differences between peak (15:00–17:00) and off-peak (08:00–11:00) hours through box plot visualizations. The results show that PreCheck consistently offers shorter and more stable waiting times than Regular checkpoints, while peak travel hours significantly increase delays, providing insights into airport security efficiency and passenger flow patterns.
